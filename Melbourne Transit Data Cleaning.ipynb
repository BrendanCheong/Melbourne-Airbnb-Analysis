    "# Melbourne Airbnb Senitment Analysis\n",
    "Welcome to my analysis of Melbourne Airbnb data. The question I aim to solve is as follows:\n",
    "- What are the most common words used in the transit description in relation to the price of the Airbnb?\n",
    "- How does prices correlate to transit descriptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "**_places with lowest distance transit (aka most accessible) will have the highest prcies_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I will attempt to clean the data, create a wordcloud based on the most common words in the 'transit' column and see if there is a correlation between certain words and the price level"
