    "# Prices and Accessibility\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen from the WordCloud Nltk analysis, some of the most common words commonly grouped up together includes the words \"walk\", \"minutes\", \"tram\", \"train\" and \"stations\". This suggests that accessibility is measured by _walking distance_ and places where _tram_ and _train station_ services are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, my initial hypothesis still holds: **_more accessible Airbnbs are more expensive_**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find out how price relates to accessibility, I must assign points to places where its more accessible in some sort of \"accessibility score\". Here are some ideas I can implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attach a positivity score based on the number of attractions available in transit\n",
    "- Attach a transport_options score based on the number of transport options available\n",
    "- Attach a walking score. The lower the time taken to get to transport, the higher the score **\n",
    "\n",
    "But first lets clean the data a bit more, by standardising the the word \"minute\". I want every variation of the that word to be standardised as \"minutes\"."
